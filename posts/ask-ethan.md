Ethan answers any and all your questions with care and attention, while also providing a plainspoken, straight-shooting dose of reality that often only comes to us from close friends!

Ask Ethan is a syndicated advice column Android app written in Java and using Google Firebase. It supports a real time database. Basically what this means is that an update or event on any person's activity on my app can be reflected to all users in real time. So if you post a question to ask me, every user and I will see it immediately.

I built this full stack app in just two weeks. Over my winter break as a student at Johns Hopkins University, I wanted to learn a new technology and build something that is feasible given the time constraint. I was at a stage in my career where I had to be quick at learning and picking up the unknown pieces. I came across Google Firebase and was utterly astonished!

Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment. The Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.

It's considered a Backend-as-a-service. This means the whole entire backend may be serviced, leaving the developers more time to spend on the front end client code. This level of abstracation was something I needed and appreciated. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel to code the authentication and authorization layer of my app. I wanted something quick and dirty and easy to use. With Google Firebase, I just had to set up my API key and that's pretty much it. As for calling the API code, it's just a matter of adding one or two lines into my app. Firebase supports authentication with Google account or Facebook etc, I opted out for the simple username and password approach.

This was a very fun app to design and build! I learned so much from standing up an idea to deploying my app on Google Playstore. It gave me so much confidence in my skills and potential. My friends loved this app, too! They like how they can ask me any questions and only I can answer. The app may be a bit egotistical but hilarious nevertheless.
