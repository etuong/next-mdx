## Pair Programming and TDD

#### Advantages of Pair Programming:

1. Learn from each other
1. Detect bugs via inspection
1. Increase onboarding
1. Reduced distraction and interruption cost

#### Six Styles in Pair Programming:

- Unstructured pairing - do whatever you want
- Driver Navigator - Driver types and implements, navigator be on the lookout for mistakes and concerns. Works well with two experts or expert and novice.
- Backseat Navigator - Same as driver navigator but the navigator dictates tactical instructions. Works best with novice-expert pairings.
- Tour Guide - Driver does everything and verbal tells the tourist everything he does and sees, tourist rarely intervenes.
- Ping-Pong Pairing - The cadence works simply enough. The first person writes a failing test and the second person gets it to pass. Then the second person writes a failing test and the first person gets it to path. Back and forth, back and forth. Kind of like a game of ping pong.

#### Challenge in Pair Programming:

- Infrastructure - the common hardware and software setup used by the team when pairing;
- Fatigue - the energy spent by a teammate to keep the focus during the pairing activity; and
- Ego - the challenge of staying humble and avoiding arguments.

#### 10 Ways to Improve Pairing Experience:

1. Do not centralize driving
1. Manage the focus together
1. Avoid working alone
1. Alternate moments of concentration and relaxation
1. Celebrate your achievements!
1. Synchronize with your partner
1. Give context appropriately
1. Learn to deal with disagreements
1. Be ready to learn and to teach
1. Give and receive feedback when you're done

## Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)

The Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software engineering practice that requires unit tests to be written before the code they are supposed to validate.

Test-last approach has limitations due to confirmation bias.

Test-first is one of the pillars of Extreme Programming (XP) methodology. The benefit is easier to maintain in the future for new features or refactoring operations.

Principles:
By combining programming, unit test writing and refactoring, TDD is a structuring practice that allows to obtain a clean code, easy to modify and answering the expressed needs which remains the first priority when developing an application.

Red phase: First write a unit test that fails.
Green phase: Write passable production code
Refactor phase: Optimize code

A unit test should represent only one concept and contain only one assertion.

A clean test follows FIRST rules:

- Fast: a test must be fast to be executed often.
- Independent: tests must not depend on each other.
- Repeatable: a test must be reproducible in any environment.
- Self-Validating: a test must have a binary result (Failure or Success) for a quick and easy conclusion.
- Timely: a test must be written at the appropriate time, i.e. just before the production code it will validate.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
