- "DO NOT TOUCH" would probably be a really unsettling thing to read in braille.

- My dog understands several human words but I don't understand any dog barks. Does this mean he is smarter than me?

- We need to stop saying that something is on fire. Nothing is on fire, fire is on things.

- Can you imagine when aliens come to visit us and we have to explain to them why we made hundreds of movies about killing them?

- History classes are only going to get longer and harder as time goes on.

- Our stomach thinks that all potatoes are mashed.

- I think tobacco companies should be leading in the search for a cancer cure. If there is a cure for lung cancer, wouldn't that help their business?

- In normal English, execute and kill are synonyms, but on a computer, they're antonyms.

- If I punch myself in the face and it hurts...does that make me weak or strong?
