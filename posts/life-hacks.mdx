### Automatically move cursor

We have all been there. At work, there's always that one person who's stalking you to make sure you're online. So, once in a while you'd touch your mouse to move the cursor a bit so your messenger is active and your status is green. Well, let's make life simple with a simple Python script.

```
import pyautogui as pag
import random
import time

while True:
	x = random.randint(600,700)
	y = random.randint(200,600)
	pag.moveTo(x,y,0.5)
	time.sleep(2)
```
