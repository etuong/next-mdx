Cloud computing: the hardware, software, and applications you're using may be anywhere up in the "cloud." As long as it all does what you want, you don't need to worry where it is or how it works.

Cloud computing means that instead of all the computer hardware and software you're using sitting on your desktop, or somewhere inside your company's network, it's provided for you as a service by another company and accessed over the Internet, usually in a completely seamless way. Exactly where the hardware and software is located and how it all works doesn't matter to you; it's just somewhere up in the nebulous "cloud" that the Internet represents. In other words, it is almost like "outsourcing" computing services. Some basic examples of cloud computing include Google drive and Spotify. You do not need to worry or know or care about where content is stored, you just care about what are the provided services and how to use them. Google does all the dirty work for you such as developing the software and maintaining it, you may use it for free, and Google earns the money back through advertising and other paid-for-services. Cloud computing is desired because it is managed and on-demand, cloud services are available on-demand and often bought on a "pay-as-you go" or subscription basis. Jeff Bezos said "You don't generate your own electricity. Why generate your own computing?"

There are three types of cloud computing.

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) means you're buying access to raw computing hardware over the Net, such as servers or storage. Since you buy what you need and pay-as-you-go, this is often referred to as utility computing. Ordinary web hosting is a simple example of IaaS: you pay a monthly subscription or a per-megabyte/gigabyte fee to have a hosting company serve up files for your website from their servers.
1. Software as a Service (SaaS) means you use a complete application running on someone else's system. Web-based email and Google Documents are perhaps the best-known examples. Zoho is another well-known SaaS provider offering a variety of office applications online.
1. Platform as a Service (PaaS) means you develop applications using Web-based tools so they run on systems software and hardware provided by another company. So, for example, you might develop your own ecommerce website but have the whole thing, including the shopping cart, checkout, and payment mechanism running on a merchant's server. App Cloud (from salesforce.com) and the Google App Engine are examples of PaaS.

Pros

- Lower upfront costs and reduced infrastructure costs.
- Easy to grow your applications.
- Scale up or down at short notice.
- Only pay for what you use.
- Everything managed under SLAs.
- Overall environmental benefit (lower carbon emissions) of many users efficiently sharing large systems. (But see the box below.)

Cons

- Higher ongoing operating costs. Could cloud systems work out more expensive?
- Greater dependency on service providers. Can you get problems resolved quickly, even with SLAs?
- Risk of being locked into proprietary or vendor-recommended systems? How easily can you migrate to another system or service provider if you need to?
- What happens if your supplier suddenly decides to stop supporting a product or system you've come to depend on?
- Potential privacy and security risks of putting valuable data on someone else's system in an unknown location?
- If lots of people migrate to the cloud, where they're no longer free to develop neat and whizzy new things, what does that imply for the future development of the Internet?
- Dependency on a reliable Internet connection.
